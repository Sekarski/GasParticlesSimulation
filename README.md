# GasParticlesSimulation
simulating particles of noble gases coliding together in a closed space

This was our first year OO programming class project, implemented in C++ in 2014.

The comments and documentaiton is all in French, as that was the profs native language.
The front-end of the simulation can be either textual in the terminal, or graphical, using wxwidgets, but I haven't tried running it since 2014, so there's probably some dependencies that need to be downloaded, and some things might be deprecated.
